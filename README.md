# rust-gb
A [gameboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) emulator written in rust.

## Why create another emulator? There's a bunch of gameboy emulators!
I wanted to extend my skills, and emulators looks like a black magic to me.
So I decided to write an emulator.

I feel like I understand computers better.
And emulators still look like a black magic.
And I think [Dolphin Emulator](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/Dolphin) devs deserves some respects.
They are awesome.

## Why is 'initial commit' so big?
At the beginning, I never cared to publish it, so just did not care to make any commits while developing.
But guess I'm screwed now. :(
